  The rewrite is allowed to do anything at all to the delta: add extra entities, create relations, augment
  entities, or even clear the delta to an empty map so nothing will be saved.

  The `rewrite-fn` should be a `(fn [pathom-env delta] updated-delta)`. You *can* return nil to indicate no
  rewrite is needed, but any other return will be used as the new thing to save (instead of what was sent).

  The `delta` has the format of a normalized Fulcro form save:

  ```
  {[:account/id 19] {:account/age {:before 42 :after 43}
                     :account/items {:before [] :after [[:item/id 1]]}}
   [:item/id 1] {:item/value {:before 22M :after 19.53M}}}
