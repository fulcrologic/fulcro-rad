(ns com.fulcrologic.rad.blob
  "Support for dealing with binary large objects (e.g. file upload, storage, and retrieval of images, documents, etc.)

  To use this support you must:

  - Add wrap-persist-images from this ns to your form save middleware
  - Install the Fulcro Ring middleware `file-upload/wrap-mutation-file-uploads`.
  - Configure an HTTP remote on the client with `file-upload/wrap-file-upload` HTTP remote request middleware.
  - Add the and install the `upload-file` mutation from this ns into your pathom resolver.
  - Add `::blob/temporary-store` to your Pathom env.
  - Add a `::blob/stores` map to associate store names to Storage components to your Pathom env.
  - Configure attributes that will handle files. This support assumes some storage adapter will store the URL
  of the file uploaded, and the file data will go in some other store (e.g. S3, disk, etc.). So, you configure
  a to-one string attribute with:
  ** The form field style to use a renderer that supports file uploads.
  ** ::blob/store to indicate the identifer of an implementation of blob-storage/Storage. "
