  "Forms use a state machine to control their behavior. Normally that state machine is started when you route to
  it using Fulcro's dynamic router system. If you start with a form on-screen, or do not use routing, then you will
  have to call this function when the form first appears in order to ensure it operates. Calling this function is
  *destructive* and will re-start the form's machine and destroy any current state in that form.

  * app - The app
  * id - The ID of the form, in the correct type (i.e. int, UUID, etc.). Use a `tempid` to create something new, otherwise
  the form will attempt to load the current value from the server.
  * form-class - The component class that will render the form and has the form's configuration.
  * params - Extra parameters to include in the initial event data. The state machine definition you're using will
    determine the meanings of these (if any). The default machine supports:
    ** `:on-saved fulcro-txn` A transaction to run when the form is successfully saved. Exactly what you'd pass to `transact!`.
    ** `:on-cancel fulcro-txn` A transaction to run when the edit is cancelled.
    ** `:on-save-failed fulcro-txn` A transaction to run when the server refuses to save the data.
    ** `:embedded? boolean` Disable history and routing for embedded forms. Default false.

  The state machine definition used by this method can be overridden by setting `::form/machine` in component options
  to a different Fulcro uism state machine definition. Machines do *not* run in subforms, only in the master, which
  is what `form-class` will become for that machine.

   Calculate a default value for any to-many attributes on the form. This is part of the recursive algorithm that

   If a form has subform configuration that declares a `::form/default` which is a vector, then each element
   in that vector will generate new subform state.

   The result will be a `merge` of:

   ```
   (merge (form/default-state SubformClass id) default-value {id-key id})
   ```

   If no defaults are provided you will at least get something that will normalize properly.

   Example:

   ```

      ::form/default-values {:people [{} {} {}]} ; overrides what is on attributes
      ::form/subforms {:people {::form/ui Person}}})

   Default value can be a 0-arg function. Each *value* can be a 1-arg function that receives a tempid to put on the
