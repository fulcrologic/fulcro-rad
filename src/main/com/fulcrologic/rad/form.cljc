   Calculate a default value for any to-many attributes on the form. This is part of the recursive algorithm that

   If a form has subform configuration that declares a `::form/default` which is a vector, then each element
   in that vector will generate new subform state.

   The result will be a `merge` of:

   ```
   (merge (form/default-state SubformClass id) default-value {id-key id})
   ```

   If no defaults are provided you will at least get something that will normalize properly.

   Example:

   ```
