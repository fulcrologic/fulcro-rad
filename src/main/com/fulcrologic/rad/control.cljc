  "Controls are buttons and inputs in the UI that are not backed by model data, but instead
   control things like report parameters or provide action buttons. This namespace provides
   functions to help with UI plugin development, and other functions that reduce the amount
   of boilerplate data when declaring controls.

   A typical control is added to a component by adding a ::control/controls key, which
   is a map from made-up control key to a control definition map.

   ```
   (defsc-form Form [this props]
     {::control/controls {::new {:type :button
                                 :label \"Go\"
                                 :action (fn [this] ...)}}})
   ```

   Render plugins can then expose layout keys that allow you to place the controls. For example as action
   buttons. See ::form/action-buttons.
