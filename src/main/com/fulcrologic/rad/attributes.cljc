     "Define a new attribute into a sym.

     WARNING: IF YOU ARE DOING FULL-STACK, THEN THESE MUST BE DEFINED IN CLJC FILES FOR RAD TO WORK! RAD actually supports
     the idea of having rendering plugins that work just in the JVM, in which case all of your code can be CLJ. It can
     also support client-side database adapters, which would mean that all of your code would be CLJS.

     * `sym`: The name of the new var to create.
     * `qualified-keyword`: The unique (keyword) name of this attribute.
     * `data-type`: A supported data type (e.g. :int, :uuid, :ref, :instant).
     * `options-map`: An open map (any data can be placed in here) of key-value pairs.

     An attribute defines a logical bit of data in your graph model that may be stored in a database, derived by complex
     logic, or simply generated out of thin air.  Attributes are the central place in RAD where information *about* your
     desired data model is supplied.

     The most common options to put in `options-map` are:

     * `::attr/identities` - if persisted in storage, but NOT a table/row/entity key.
     * `::attr/identity?` - if a PK or natural key
     * `::attr/schema` - if persisted in storage
     * `::attr/target` - if type `:ref`

     See the `attributes-options` namespace for more details.

     Attributes types are extensible (though there are many built in), and the concept of traversal to to-one and to-many
     edges in either direction is very easily represented in a natural, database-independent, fashion (though database
     adapters may require you to supply more information in order for them to actually do concrete work for you).

     A attribute is required to have a *qualified key* that uniquely designates its name in the model, and a data
     type. The options map is a completely open map of key-value pairs that can further describe the details of
     an attribute. Some of those are standard options (found in the attributes-options namespace), and many more
     are defined by reports, forms, database adapters, and rendering plugins. Look for `*-options` namespaces in
     order to find vars with docstrings that describe the possible options."
