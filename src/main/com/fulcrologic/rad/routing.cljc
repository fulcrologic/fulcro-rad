(ns com.fulcrologic.rad.routing
  "A support layer for application-level routing. RAD supports the idea of an *application-level* history. This
  allows it to abstract over the concepts of relative navigation since it can be used
  on many platforms (like React Native or Electron) where no natural browser history API exists.

  History support in RAD requires that you install an implementation of RouteHistory at application start time. See
  `com.fulcrologic.rad.routing.history` and associated namespaces.

  Functions in this namespace that do relative routing will silently fail if no such history support is installed."
